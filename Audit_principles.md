#Description: Course notes

> 100% coverage != bug free code

- Unit Testing

  - find bugs early

- Integration testing

  - catch bugs at composability level

- path dependence

  - risks sandwich / Mev

- path independence

> Int256.min not be cast to int256.max as it will be int256.max +1

Math heavy functions always good fuzzing targets

MAKE A LIST OF INVARIANTS

Good fuzzer > quality of invariants & limitations of harness.
